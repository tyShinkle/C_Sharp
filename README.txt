**C# Projects **


	*TicTacToe

		Thoughts:
	
			login authentication : token based.

			leader board : based on win rate.

			lobbies enabling you to play against 
		 	any one in the world : socket programming.

			AI to play against : 3 difficulties.

			Local option to play against friend on 
		 	same device : guest option.

	*TCPTestOne

		Description:

			A TcpListener (server) which listens 
			for requests (client) containing strings and
			returns to the client the same string 
			capitalized. A simple test of tcp implementation.

		ToDo:

			Keep listening after initial client ends 
			application.
